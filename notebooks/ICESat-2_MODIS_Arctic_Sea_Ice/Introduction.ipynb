The ATLAS instrument releases 10,000 laser pulses per second, split into 3 weak/strong beam pairs at a wavelength of 532 nanaometers (bright green on the visible spectrum). Measurements are taken every 70 cm along the satellite's ground track with a footprint diameter of 17 m. The beam pairs are spaced 3.3 km apart, with a distance of 90 m between each weak and strong beam. ICESat-2 orbits Earth every 91 days to allow for height change detection in all four seasons. In addition to land ice and sea ice, ICESat-2 also measures the height of vegetation, land surface, water, and clouds.
