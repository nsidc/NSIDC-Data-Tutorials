    "\n",
    "Comparing measurements across altimetry data sets where latitude, longitude, and surface heights have been collected over long periods of time – a span of 25+ year in the case of ICESat/GLAS, IceBridge and ICESat-2 – requires us to account for evolving coordinate reference systems and tectonic plate movement. To demonstrate why plate movement matters over time, let’s look at the Australian plate. It is moving at a rate of around 7 cm / year, so over 25 years the continent will have moved nearly 1.8 m. All of Earth’s land masses are affected by plate movement to varying degrees, and over a multi-decade time series it’s important to recognize that the position recorded for a location in 1993 is going to be different from what would be recorded at that same location today. Plate movement and updates to coordinate reference systems over time must be accounted for when analyzing data over long time periods to avoid drawing spurious conclusions from the data."

    "## Important Terms and Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "* Coordinate system: The 2-dimensional (latitude, longitude) or 3-dimensional (latitude, longitude, height) system, and unit of measure used to define where a point is located in space.\n",
    "* Datum: A modeled version of the shape of the Earth which defines the origin used to place the coordinate system in space.\n",
    "* Coordinate Reference System (CRS): A CRS comprises a coordinate system and a datum.\n",
    "* Epoch (datum epoch): An epoch is used to identify the date at which a given reference frame was realized. They are also used to date when the coordinates for a particular observation (e.g., lat, lon, elevation) were obtained. Epochs are noted in decimal year format (YYYY.DD) where numbers to the right of the decimal are derived from the Julian day-in-year. The decimal year is equal to: year + day-in-year/365 (or 366 for leap years). For example, 1 January 2010 is written as 2010.00; 5 May 1991 is the 128th Julian day-in-year and written as 1991.35. To determine what month and day is represented by, say, 2018.5, multiply the numbers to the right of the decimal by the total number of days in 2018 (.5 * 365) to determine the Julian day-in-year is 183 (after rounding up to a whole number). Referencing a Julian date calendar (e.g., [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/custom.html?year=2020&country=1&doy=1&df=1) ) we see that 2018.5 corresponds to 2 July 2018.\n",
    "* International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF): A realization (i.e., a major adjustment) of the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS). Its origin is at the center of mass of the whole earth including the oceans and atmosphere. New ITRF solutions are produced every few years as the Earth changes and to employ the latest mathematical and surveying techniques to attempt to realize the ITRS as precisely as possible. Examples include ITRF88, ITRF93, ITRF2000, etc., with ITRF2014 being the latest realization of the ITRS. The ITRS is a formal description of the coordinate reference system, along with the mathematical and experimental procedures used to create reference frames and is maintained by the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS). The IERS issues parameters for transforming to and from older ITRF realizations. This makes it convenient to compare locations at any point on the Earth, but only for the same time, or epoch. Comparing coordinates in a dynamic frame from different epochs presents problems since the geographic features are being moved by plate tectonics, resulting in different coordinates for the same feature."

We construct a set of coordinates roughly on the Greenland ice sheet, with fictitious elevations.
