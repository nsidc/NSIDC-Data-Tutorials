    "This Jupyter notebook is  an interactive document to teach students and researchers interested in cryospheric sciences about airborne altimetry and related data sets from NASAâ€™s [IceBridge](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/icebridge/index.html) mission, and satellite altimetry data from [ICESat/GLAS](https://icesat.gsfc.nasa.gov/icesat/) and [ICESat-2](https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov/). Accessing and combining data from these different missions can be difficult as file formats and coordinate reference systems changed over time.\n",

    "After completing this notebook you will:\n",
    "* Understand the basics about pre-IceBridge, IceBridge, ICESat/GLAS and ICESat-2 datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Mission Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2003, NASA launched the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite mission with the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (ICESat/GLAS) instrument onboard. Over the following six years, ICESat/GLAS collected valuable ice thickness data in the Polar Regions. Unfortunately, the ICESat/GLAS mission ended in 2009 before a follow-up mission could be launched. An airborne campaign called Operation IceBridge was funded to fill the gap and continue ice thickness measurements. Between 2009 and 2019, Operation IceBridge flew numerous campaigns over Greenland, the Antarctic ice sheets, and sea ice in the Arctic and Southern Ocean. In September 2018, ICESat-2 was launched to continue NASA's collection of ice, cloud and land elevation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wealth of data from these three missions, as well as from the pre-IceBridge airborne altimetry missions, presents an opportunity to study the evolution of ice thickness over several decades. However, combining data from these missions presents several challenges:\n",
    "* Data from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) flown during the IceBridge campaigns is stored in four different file formats. ICESat/GLAS and ICESat-2 data are also in different file formats. Therefore, the data needs to be harmonized, that means placed into similar formats before comparisons can be made.\n",
    "* The coordinate reference systems used to locate measurements have changed over the years, as the Earth's surface is not static and changes shape. To account for these changes, terrestrial reference frames that relate latitude and longitude to points on the Earth are updated on a regular basis. Since the launch of ICESat/GLAS, the International Terrestrial Reference Frame [(ITRF)](https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/DataProducts/ITRF/itrf.html) has been updated three times. The geolocation of a point measured at the beginning of the record and the end of the record is not the same even though the latitude and longitude is the same. These changes in geolocation need to be reconciled to allow meaningful comparisons within the long-term data record.\n",
    "\n",
    "The companion [corrections.ipynb](./corrections.ipynb) notebook contains information about how to perform ITRF transformations using [PyProj](https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2.1 Pre-IceBridge**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) is a conically-scanning laser altimeter that measures the surface topography of a swath of terrain directly beneath the path of an aircraft. ATM surveys can be used to detect surface changes. Differences of laser swaths surveyed over the same area but a few years apart can be used to estimate elevation changes between the first and second survey. Comparing the surveys conducted 1993-4 and 1998-9 resulted in the first comprehensive assessment of the mass balance change of the Greenland ice sheet ([Krabill et al., 1999](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/283/5407/1522), [2000](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/289/5478/428)).  ATM surveys can also be used to calibrate/validate satellite altimeter measurements (e.g. [Martin et al., 2005](https://atm.wff.nasa.gov/files/browser/ATM_Calibration_Procedures_and_Accuracy_Assessment_2012.pdf)).  The ATM was deployed on a wide variety of platforms, including the NASA P3, a Chilean Navy P3, a US Navy P3, the NASA DC8, the NCAR C-130, and a half-dozen Twin Otters to collected high quality topographic data. For a complete list of the ATM deployments visit [https://atm.wff.nasa.gov/deployments/](https://atm.wff.nasa.gov/deployments/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2.2 ICESat/GLAS**\n",
    "\n",
    "ICESat/GLAS was the benchmark Earth Observing System mission for measuring ice sheet mass balance, cloud and aerosol heights, as well as land topography and vegetation characteristics. From 2003 to 2009, the ICESat/GLAS mission provided multi-year elevation data for ice sheet mass balance as well as stratospheric cloud property information over polar areas. This mission also provided topographic and vegetation data from around the globe beyond the polar-specific ice height information over the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Launched on 12 January 2003, after seven years in orbit and 18 laser-operation campaigns, the ICESat/GLAS science mission ended due to the failure of its primary instrument in 2009.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2.3 IceBridge**\n",
    "\n",
    "The operation IceBridge was with its surveying flights from 2009 to 2019 the largest airborne survey of the Earth's polar ice. It has yielded an unprecedented three-dimensional view of the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets, ice shelves and sea ice. The flights provide a yearly, multi-instrument look at the behavior of the rapidly changing features of the polar ice.\n",
    "Data collected during Operation IceBridge helps scientists bridge the gap in polar satellite observations between ICESat/GLAS (2003-2009) and ICESat-2 (2018-present). Although the IceBridge data are not continuous its mission became critical for extending the ice altimetry time series in the Arctic and Antarctic, after ICESat/GLAS stopped collecting data in 2009.\n",
    "\n",
    "IceBridge flights were generally conducted in March-May over Greenland and in October-November over Antarctica.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2.4 ICESat-2**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ICESat-2 mission was designed to provide elevation data needed to determine ice sheet mass balance as well as vegetation canopy information. It provides topographic measurements of cities, lakes and reservoirs, oceans and land surfaces around the globe. The sole instrument on ICESat-2 is the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), a space-based Lidar. It was designed and built at Goddard Space Flight Center, with the laser generation and detection systems provided by Fibertek. ATLAS measures the travel time of laser photons from the satellite to Earth and back; travel times from multiple laser pulses are used to determine elevation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We reccomend using the [*icepyx*](https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx) library to access and interact with ICESat-2 data. \n",
