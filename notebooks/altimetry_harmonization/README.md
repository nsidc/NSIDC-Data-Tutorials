# IceFlow Point Cloud Data Access

## Summary

The IceFlow notebooks provide information about how to access and work with
airborne altimetry and related data sets from NASAâ€™s
[IceBridge](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/icebridge/index.html) mission,
and satellite altimetry data from
[ICESat/GLAS](https://icesat.gsfc.nasa.gov/icesat/) and
[ICESat-2](https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov/). Accessing and combining data from
these different missions can be difficult as file formats and coordinate
reference systems changed over time.

The [0_introduction.ipynb](./0_introduction.ipynb) notebbook provides a
descriptive background on the data.

The [corrections.ibynb](./corrections.ibynb) notebook prodvides a small example
of how to perform an ITRF coordinate transformations to facilitate data
comparison across datasets.


## Setup

To run the notebooks provided in this folder, please see the
[NSIDC-Data-Tutorials repository
readme](https://github.com/nsidc/NSIDC-Data-Tutorials#readme) for instructions
on several ways (using Binder, Docker, or Conda) to do this.

## Key Learning Objectives

1. Learn the basics about the data sets (pre-IceBridge, IceBridge, ICESat/GLAS and ICESat-2) served by the IceFlow library.

2. Learn to access these data sets using the IceFlow user interface widget.

3. Learn to access these data sets using the IceFlow API.

4. Learn to read and analyze the data using IceFlow.
