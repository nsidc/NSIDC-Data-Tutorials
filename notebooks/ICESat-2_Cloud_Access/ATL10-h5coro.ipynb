    "## **1. Tutorial Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is designed for the \"DAAC data access in the cloud hands-on experience\" session at the 2023 NSIDC DAAC [User Working Group (UWG)](https://nsidc.org/data/data-programs/nsidc-daac/about-daac#anchor-2) Meeting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The NSIDC DAAC archives and distributes Daily and Monthly Gridded [Sea Ice Freeboard (ATL20)](https://nsidc.org/data/atl20) and [Polar Sea Surface Height Anomaly (ATL21)](https://nsidc.org/data/atl21) data sets from the ICESat-2 Mission, derived from the lower level [ATL10](https://nsidc.org/data/atl10) data set. However, we may want these lower level point data to be gridded and averaged at a weekly cadence, or using a different projection or other gridding parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial session is in two parts: \n",
    "* We will first guide you through this Jupyter Notebook running in the AWS `us-west-2` region, where data are hosted in the NASA Earthdata Cloud. The notebook utilizes several libraries to performantly search, access, read, and grid the data including `earthaccess`, `h5coro`, and `geopandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This notebook will focus on the Ross Sea, Antarctica. But let’s say we want to scale this analysis to the entire continent. In the second portion, we will present how to scale and run this same workflow from a script (see [workflow.py](./h5cloud/workflow.py) in the `h5cloud` folder within this notebook's directory) that can be run from your laptop, using [Coiled](https://www.coiled.io/). \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Credits**\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook was created by Andy Barrett and Luis Lopez of NSIDC.\n",
    "\n",
    "For questions regarding the notebook, or to report problems, please create a new issue in the [NSIDC-Data-Tutorials repo](https://github.com/nsidc/NSIDC-Data-Tutorials/issues).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Learning Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this demonstration you will be able to:  \n",
    "1. use `earthaccess` to authenticate with Earthdata Login, search for ICESat-2 data using spatial and temporal filters, and directly access files in the cloud.\n",
    "2. open data granules using `h5coro` to efficiently read HDF5 data from the NSIDC DAAC S3 bucket\n",
    "3. load data into a geopandas.DataFrame containing geodetic coordinates, ancillary variables, and date/time converted from ATLAS Epoch\n",
    "4. grid track data to EASE-Grid v2 6.25 km projected grid using drop-in-the-bucket resampling \n",
    "5. calculate mean statistics and assign aggregated data to grid cells \n",
    "5. visualize aggregated sea ice height data on a map\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Prerequisites**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We are running this notebook in the [CryoCloud](https://book.cryointhecloud.com/intro.html) JupyterHub. For more information, see the CryoCloud [Getting Started](https://book.cryointhecloud.com/content/Getting_Started.html) documentation.\n",
    "**It is advised that you use at least a 16GB instance for this notebook.** \n",
    "2. An Earthdata Login is required for data access. If you don't have one, you can register for one [here](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/).\n",
    "3. It is recommended that you create a .netrc file that contains your Earthdata Login credentials, stored in your home directory. If you do not have a .netrc file, `earthaccess` will prompt you to enter your Earthdata Login username and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example of end product** \n",
    "At the end of this tutorial, the following figure will be generated, demonstrating a year's worth of ATL10 Sea Ice Freeboard height data gridded over the Ross Sea, Antarctica:\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Time requirement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Allow approximately 40 minutes to complete this tutorial."

This is analogous to how you would work with files on your local filesystem.  However, _under the hood_ there are differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we load data for each year into a `geopandas.DataFrame`.  `geopandas` is an extension of the `pandas` package.  `pandas` is designed to work with `tabular` data - _think data you might put into a spreadsheet_.  `geopandas`, extends `pandas` to work with geospatial data by adding geometries (points, lines and polygons) and a coordinate reference system (CRS), so that data in each row is associated with a geospatial feature located on Earth.  ICESat-2 track data is well suited to the DataFrame data model because data are related to points or segments.  Once data is in a `geopandas.DataFrame`, the data can be reprojected and queried using methods you may be used to using in a GIS."

    "#### Read data into `geopandas.DataFrame`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to read the data and put it into a Dataframe.  We use `h5coro`, which is a package developed by the SlideRule project to efficiently read HDF5 files in the cloud.  Recall from the Cloud Optimized Format presentation, the HDF5 format and the HDF5 library for reading and writing those files are not well suited to accessing data in the cloud.  `h5coro` was developed to solve some of the problems related to HDF5 format and tools.  Using `h5coro` with `dask`, a python package for parallel processing on multicore local machines and distributed cluster in the cloud, reading data from ATL10 files is 5x faster than using the `h5py` package, an HDF5 reader that uses the HDF5 library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code to read the data is long, so we have created the `read_atl10` function and put it in a module.  The function is imported into this notebook.  If your are interested, take a look at `read_atl10` in [`read_atl10.py`](./h5cloud/read_atl10.py).  The main features of the function are briefly described here.\n",
    "\n",
    "We follow the processing steps for ATL20 to generate our freeboard grids.  For each grid cell that contain one or more freeboard segments, a grid cell mean freeboard is calculated as a mean of `gtx/freeboard_segment/beam_fb_height` from ATL10, weighted by segment length `gtx/freeboard_segment/heights/height_segment_length_seg`.  To resample segments to grid cells, we also need the geodetic coordinates for each segment in `gtx/freeboard_segment/latitude` and `gtx/freeboard_segment/longitude`. As an additional locator, we also read `gtx/freeboard_segment/delta_time`.  `gtx` is the beam number.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the segment data, we also need some ancillary data from each file.  In ATL20 gridded freeboards are calculated using only the _strong beams_ of each beam pair.  Which of the six beams are strong and which are weak depends on the orientation of the ICESat-2 satellite.  Satellite orientation is given in the `orbit_info/sc_orient` dataset.  We also need to read the Atlas Standard Data Product Epoch that is stored in `ancillary_data/atlas_sdp_gps_epoch` to convert `delta_time` from seconds since launch to date and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "There are three beam pairs numbered 1, 2 and 3.  Each of these beam pairs has a left and right beam.  Beams are numbered `gt1l` and `gt1r`, `gt2l` and `gt2r`, and `gt3l` and `gt3r`.  Depending on the orientation of the ICESat-2 satellite, left beams or right beams are the _strong beams_.    The orientation can be _forward_ or _backward_, or _transition_.  We only use data in forward or backward orientations.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets containing segment data are stored in the `DATASETS` constant, which is a python `list`, in `reader.py`.  If you want additional or different datasets, you can modify this list. See [NSIDC DAAC's ATL10 User Guide](https://nsidc.org/sites/default/files/documents/user-guide/atl10-v006-userguide.pdf) and [ATL10 Data Dictionary](https://nsidc.org/sites/default/files/documents/technical-reference/icesat2_atl10_data_dict_v006.pdf) for detailed descriptions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A ATL10 file is read using the function `read_atl10`. This function encapsulates opening an HDF5 file and reading the datasets using `h5coro`, and then creating a `geopandas.DataFrame` containing the data.  We parallelize the reading of all files in a year using `pqdm`, so files are read using different processors.  File for a given year are then concatenated into a single dataframe."
